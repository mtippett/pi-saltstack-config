# saltstack-config
This project is a prototype project used for exploring saltstack for a collection of Raspberry Pis on a home network.  YMMV

This is intended as a personal project, but feel free to fork and provide pull requests.

# Bootstrapping
Fortunately as of this writing, raspbian already has salt-minion available with the apt source.  So installing raspberry pi is as easy as

    apt-get install salt-minion
